# AES
Advanced Encryption Standard For 128, 194, or 256-bit keys

aesEncrypt() encrypts a 16-byte block of plaintext using a key to produce the ciphertext.

aesDecrypt() takes the 16-byte ciphertext with the key and decrypts it back into the plaintext.

I created this project for an assignment in CS-465 Computer Security at BYU. 
My main resource was the FIPS-197 AES standard from 2001: https://students.cs.byu.edu/~cs465ta/labs/fips-197.pdf
I also used the resources here: https://cswiki.cs.byu.edu/cs-465/project-1-aes

DISCLAIMER: The project is not intended to be used as an AES solution, but was created for educational purposes.
